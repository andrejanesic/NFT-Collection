# NFT Collection

Demonstration of how to create a sellable NFT collection that includes a presale to whitelisted addresses.

The project includes two submodules:

1. [`client`](https://github.com/andrejanesic/NFT-Collection.Client): a small React application that lets the user interact with the contract
2. [`contract`](https://github.com/andrejanesic/NFT-Collection.Contract): the smart contract developed in Solidity
